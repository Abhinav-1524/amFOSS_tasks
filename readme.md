## My views about the tasks
I feel the tasks are a bit difficult for a beginner.As i am a absolutely beginner it is what i felt but it is a great exposure to the programming world.I felt like 1 month is a bit short time to learn from scratch and work on it but the time period doesn't matter here because it depends on how we learn or what we learn.But it took me time i had to learn everything .By each and every task i've learnt new things.I can proudly say this 1 month because of this tasks i am far better than many people.These tasks thought me a lot.
## My Introduction
Hi senior i am Abhinav.k from hyderabad ,telangana.When i found out i scored a good rank amrita  i researched about it and the first and very prominent thing i heard about this amritapuri campus's is clubs and i was a bit attraacted by this and there i found AMFOSS .I then researched about this club and was really dragged in to it and started to imagine myself in it.It is where i found my intrest and then i decided to join amritapuri campus and here i am.Actually i had intrest into computers and stuff from childhood itself as i am  always into computer games.But i found this club really amazing and it was more than what i had imagined.I feel this club helps me to shape my career.
