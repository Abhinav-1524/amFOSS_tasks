#RUST
Rust was the task i struggled on mostly.Everything is new in here.I folowed the resources and did some research based on it . I got many errors while writing the code and handling the data.The most difficult part here was to find class names to get the data.I watched some videos on how to take the classes but stil i couldn't find a way.At last when i tried some stuff some classes were correct but still as two of the class names are same .i was totally confused and struck there and with some help from google i could finally retrieve the data and still i got some errors while creating a csv.this was the task i totally worked on long .
