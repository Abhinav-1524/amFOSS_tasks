#FLAME_GAME
Flutter was one of my favourite task .I really enjoyed every second doing this task.I learnt flutter from the youtube videos which was given resources and some of my research. i watched some videos on dart programming languages too.But here i added a joystick instead of buttons .The reason i didn't add buttons is i couldn't figure out how to add them .I went wrong a lot of times. I did this task for around 6 days but couldn't able to figure it out properly as i can't waste time anymore i'm just uploading my first model.But this was the the best task i worked on.I liked it so much and i explored about the android devolpment using Flutter.
