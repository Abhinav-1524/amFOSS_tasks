# Terminal hunt
This is the first task i started to work in linux and i liked the idea behind it.It's adventerous and i learnt a lot from this task like the basics of git and terminal.This task took me a day as i have to learn everything and there was a time i was struck in between and i pretty much passed it with ease.It felt great doing this task.
